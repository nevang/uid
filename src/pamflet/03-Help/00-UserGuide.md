==========

uid use is very simple. You define the structure of the ids via a 
[`Scheme`](latest/api/gr/jkl/uid/Scheme.html) and then you generate ids via a 
[`Generator`](latest/api/gr/jkl/uid/Generator.html). You can choose to generate 
ids as Longs or use the [`Id`](latest/api/gr/jkl/uid/Id.html) type of the 
library.
