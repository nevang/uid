package gr.jkl.uid

/** Value class of 64-bit Ids with underlying type of Long.
  *
  * An Id instance doesn't know about the way it is structured. This depends on
  * the [[gr.jkl.uid.Scheme Scheme]] of its [[gr.jkl.uid.Generator! Generator]].
  * So, the methods whiches extract parameters (e.g. `timestamp`, `node` and
  * `sequence`) from an Id require an implicit Scheme. Consequently, those
  * methods will return different results depending on the provided Scheme.
  *
  * Generally, when an Id is constructed by a timestamp, a node and a sequence
  * a Scheme is required. On the other hand, an Id can be constructed by
  * a Long or a String without a Scheme.
  *
  * Ids are sorted the same way as Ids, as Longs and as Strings. The default
  * Ordering, implicit in the [[gr.jkl.uid.Id$ companion object]], sorts Ids
  * first by their timestamp, then by their node and then by their sequence.
  *
  * @param underlying The Long behind this Id.
