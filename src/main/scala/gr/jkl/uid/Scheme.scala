/** Specification of an Id implementation.
  *
  * An [[gr.jkl.uid.Id! Id]] encodes its generation time and the node which 
  * created it. An incremental number is also included in order to differntiate  
  * Ids produced on the same millisecond. The timestamp, node and the sequence 
  * data are packed into 64-bits and the Scheme specifies the number of bits of 
  * each parameter. Additionaly, a Scheme specifies the Ids epoch.
  *
  * A Scheme is required by various parts of this library so it's suggested
  * to define it implicitly.
  *
  * @param timestampBits The number of bits devoted for the Ids timestamp.
  * @param nodeBits The number of bits devoted for the Ids node.
  * @param sequenceBits The number of bits devoted for the Ids sequence.
  * @param epoch The beginning timestamp of this Id Scheme.
  * @throws IllegalArgumentException If timestamp, node and sequence bits 
  * aren't greater than 0, their sum isn't 64 or epoch is negative.
