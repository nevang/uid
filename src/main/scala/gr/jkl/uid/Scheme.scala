/** Specification of an Id implementation.
  *
  * An Id encodes its generation time and the node which 
  * created it. Ids also include an incremental number in order to differentiate  
  * Ids produced on the same time unit. The timestamp, node and the sequence 
  * data are packed into 64-bits and the Scheme specifies the number of bits of 
  * each parameter. Additionally, a Scheme specifies the beginning of time of
  * the Id implementation, a.k.a. its epoch.
  *
  * A Scheme is required by various parts of this library so it's suggested
  * to define it implicitly.
  *
  * @param timestampBits The number of bits devoted to the Id timestamp.
  * @param nodeBits The number of bits devoted to the Id node.
  * @param sequenceBits The number of bits devoted to the Id sequence.
  * @param epoch The beginning of time, in the Unix timeline, for this Scheme
  * in milliseconds (milliseconds since Unix epoch).
  * @throws IllegalArgumentException If timestamp, node and sequence bits 
  * aren't greater than 0, their sum isn't 64 or epoch is negative.
